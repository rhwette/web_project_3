          <p class="city__description">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital,
            is a large city located on the shores of the Dnipro river.
            Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
            unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it
            at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty,
            but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing. </p>
          <p class="city__description">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution,
            post-war and soviet architecture, all of it sprinkled with
            modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the Dnipro,
            the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes
            and those wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less
            interesting and prestigious though, even by people
            who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>
